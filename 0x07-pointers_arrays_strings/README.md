Pointers, arrays and strings

Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and othertasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers.

Arrays a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

Strings are actually one-dimensional array of characters terminated by a null character '\0'. Thus a null-terminate string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.
